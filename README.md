_Note: Upload MRC models and scripts here but have the train/test data locally because some are larger than the 25MB threshold that Cornell Github allows_

- Evaluating models  
   Run 'test.py' on command line with two arguments:
   + the json filename of the training data
   + the json filename to write the model prediction
   
   Run 'evaluate.py' accordingly.

- Baseline  
   A pure coin toss approach.  
   Scores 0.50 consistently for P,R, and F1

- Main model
   Insert stuff
